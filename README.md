In principle, the project is similar to React-practice_1. 
Used the following libraries.
    
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^2.11.2",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.90.12",
    "clsx": "^2.1.1",
    "react": "^19.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.2.0",
    "react-hook-form": "^7.69.0",
    "react-redux": "^9.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.11.0",
    "redux": "^5.0.1",
    "zod": "^4.2.1"

    P.S. Since the server itself comes from the training platform and I do not control it, the incoming data may change.
